# vm3dmp.sys Escape => VM Hang

The VMware display driver that is installed with vmtools vm3dmp.sys in its version 8.14.01.0051-build-2009154 is vulnerable to a local denial of service attack.

There is a particular escape operation that allows a user application to create a kernel reference to an Event object while at the same time, allocating a pool of memory. This can be called multiple times thus incrementing the reference count of the object. At some point, the OS stops responding given that all the memory was consumed.
